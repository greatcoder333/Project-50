<h1> About Us </h1>
<p> We help you make origami craft, which is special. 
Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture.
In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
Step by Step diagrams are probably the most popular and easiest to follow way to show how to fold things out of paper.
